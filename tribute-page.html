            <li>"It’s Us Who Gives Meaning To Our Comrades’ Lives."</li>
            <li>"They Want To Know What Became Of The Hearts They Gave."</li>
            <li>“Everything that You Thought Had Meaning, Every Hope, Deam or Moment of Happiness, None Of It Matters As You Lie, Bleeding Out, On The Battlefield.”</li>
            <li>“As We Ride to Certain Death, We Trust Our Successors to Do The Same For Us”</li>
            <li>"Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers Rage!"</li>
